# Toolbox Snippets
Toolbox Snippets is a library of snippets for Toolbox and its Timber Posts Module. The Timber Posts Module (for Beaver Builder) uses the built in Ace Editor and extends it with the Snippetsmanager. You can add snippets using the javascript wp hooks system to extend with your own.

This library provides you with a few handy snippets, from often used UIkit components, to custom query arguments premade.
